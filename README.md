# EmbeddingPhysX
PhysiXplorer: Navigating Physics with ChatGPT and Embeddings
At the 2023 National Physics Congress, our team was excited to present an innovative project at the intersection of artificial intelligence and physics. Our focus was on developing an interactive application that harnessed the capabilities of the ChatGPT API and embeddings technology. This application allowed users to pose questions, and in response, the application dynamically generated answers solely based on information extracted from a provided PDF document. Notably, this PDF compilation comprised numerous laboratory practices integral to the field of physics.

The foundation of our project rested on the integration of the ChatGPT API, a powerful language model capable of understanding and generating human-like text. By leveraging this API, we aimed to create an intuitive and user-friendly interface that facilitated natural language interactions with the application. The incorporation of embeddings technology further enhanced the system's ability to grasp the context and nuances of user queries, enabling more accurate and contextually relevant responses.

An exciting dimension of our work involved the local deployment and evaluation of several Language Model (LM) architectures. In particular, we ran various LLM models locally, measuring their complexity through metrics such as the entropy of Shannon. This approach provided insights into the intricacies of different language models, shedding light on their efficiency and effectiveness in handling diverse physics-related queries.

The core functionality of our application was demonstrated through a live interactive session during the congress. Attendees could ask questions related to the provided PDF document, which encompassed a wealth of laboratory practices from the physics curriculum. The application, powered by the ChatGPT API and sophisticated embeddings, dynamically generated responses. This not only showcased the potential of AI in facilitating knowledge retrieval but also highlighted the adaptability of our system in handling diverse and complex inquiries within the realm of physics.

In essence, our project exemplifies the fusion of cutting-edge AI technologies with the realm of physics, demonstrating the possibilities of interactive applications powered by language models. We believe our work opens avenues for future developments in AI-assisted research and knowledge dissemination, emphasizing the seamless integration of advanced language models and local computations to enrich scientific exploration
